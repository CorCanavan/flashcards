## Possible Future Extensions
- At the end of the game, report how much time it took for the user to complete the game in minutes and seconds.
- Add functionality so that a score of less than 90% will require the user to go through the entire dataset again.
- At the beginning of the game, give the user options for choosing to study different subjects, as well as the option for mixing all of the subjects together.
